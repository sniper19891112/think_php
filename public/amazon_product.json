For the people of Polk, building audio products is not just a job—it’s a passion. And if you’re going to remember one thing, remember this: We live by the truest principle of what audio should deliver—great sound at an affordable price for everyone! \nPolk T Series T15 Home Theater and Music Bookshelf Speaker \nThe Polk T15 home theater and music bookshelf speakers are as versatile as they come, bringing incredible home theater sound and concert-quality music all in a classic look—and at a price that won’t break your budget. \nWe took the DNA from Polk's instant-classic Monitor Series loudspeakers and re-imagined them for today's audio lover. With one 0.75-inch silk dome tweeter, a 5.25-inch composite driver, and a performance tuned front-firing bass port—all engineered with Polk’s proprietary Dynamic Balance technology—your sonic visions of brighter highs, a wide-open mid-range and surprising bass response are now a reality. The acoustically-inert, furniture-grade MDF cabinet construction also reduces resonance and distortion, so you get rich, detailed audio the way it's meant to be heard—minus the muffled noise and rattled disruption inherent in low-quality, lesser-than audio equipment. \nDesigned to produce a wide dispersion sound, setting up your T15 bookshelf speakers is super straightforward and easy no matter where you place them. You can even use them as front or rear speakers in your home audio setup, too. Their five way binding posts provide an array of secure wire-hookup options. Plus, they’re designed to work with most home theater receivers, stereos or home theater processors. Whether you’re settled in for a little tube time on the couch or you’ve got the music turned up, the T15 is performance tuned to enhance the experience—that’s a fact. Premium sound paired with affordability never sounded this awesome! \nThe Home Theater High Life \nTake your home theater experience to new heights with the T Series as your mainstay setup.

Plus, they double as rear surround speakers, too! \nBack Panel \nThe best part is that your T15 bookshelf speakers are easy to set up and connect to most home theater receivers, stereos or home theater processors. And, they’ve got a built-in keyhole slot for wall mounting. \nSee Details \nSee Details \nSee Details \nSee Details \nCustomer Reviews \n— \n\t\n— \n\t\n— \n\t\n— \n\t\nPrice — \t— \t— \t— \t\nT15 \tT30 \tT50 \tPSW10 \t\nSpeaker Use Bookshelf \tCenter \tFloor Standing \tSubwoofer \t\nDriver Size 1x 5 1/4\" Mid/Woofer. 1x 3/4\" Tweeter \t2x 5 1/4\" Mid/Woofer, 1x 1\" Tweeter \t1x 6 1/2\" Mid/Woofer, 2x 6 1/2\" Bass Radiator, 1x 1\" Tweeter \t1x 10\" Subwoofer \t\nRecommended Watts/Channel 20-100 Watts/Channel \t20-100 Watts/Channel \t20-100 Watts/Channel \tN/A \t\nPeak Power Handling 100 Watts \t100 Watts \t150 Watts \t100 Watts \t\nNominal Impedance 8 ohms \t6 ohms \t6 ohms \tN/A \t\nEnclosure Type Vented \tVented \tBass Radiator \tVented via front panel flared port \t\nOverall Frequency 60Hz-24kHz \t60Hz-24kHz \t38Hz-24kHz \t40Hz-200Hz",

With one 0.75-inch silk dome tweeter, a 5.25-inch composite driver, and a performance tuned front-firing bass port—all engineered with Polk’s proprietary Dynamic Balance technology—your sonic visions of brighter highs, a wide-open mid-range and surprising bass response are now a reality. The acoustically-inert, furniture-grade MDF cabinet construction also reduces resonance and distortion, so you get rich, detailed audio the way it's meant to be heard—minus the muffled noise and rattled disruption inherent in low-quality, lesser-than audio equipment. \nDesigned to produce a wide dispersion sound, setting up your T15 bookshelf speakers is super straightforward and easy no matter where you place them. You can even use them as front or rear speakers in your home audio setup, too. Their five way binding posts provide an array of secure wire-hookup options. Plus, they’re designed to work with most home theater receivers, stereos or home theater processors. Whether you’re settled in for a little tube time on the couch or you’ve got the music turned up, the T15 is performance tuned to enhance the experience—that’s a fact. Premium sound paired with affordability never sounded this awesome!",

By the year 2000, Pyle had undergone a massive transformation, expanding into the nascent market spaces of competitive car audio, home audio, marine audio, and professional audio & musical instruments - our Pyle Pro line. As you sit in your car, you are isolated from outside noise and surrounded by speakers. You become enveloped in sound. We have a wide range of speakers, amplifiers, and head units that will enrich your car audio experience. You’d be surprised at how much better your music can sound with an upgrade from the factory speakers and amplifier. \nPyle Car: \nWe have a wide range of speakers, amplifiers, and head units that will enrich your car audio experience. And we don’t just focus on audio at Pyle Car. Cars are a big part of our lives, and we offer a variety of products and accessories that can enhance your experience and turn your car into a modern media system on wheels, including navigation systems, DVD players, and iPod interfaces. At Pyle, we also care about your safety. That’s why we’ve also got a full line of rear and front-facing cameras that can be wired to a monitor in your car – so you can park in those tight spots or see around corners with ease. \nPyle Home: \nStart with your home theater, a stalwart of any modern house. We’ve got projectors, TVs, mounts, and stands, just to get started – all fully equipped with state-of-the-art HD technology, compatible with beautiful video game consoles like Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii, as well as your favorite Blu-Ray players, for crisp, hi-res images that explode in your eye on a mind-blowing scale. Of course, Pyle Home also carries all the cables and adaptors you need for a fully operational setup that’s sure to be the envy of your neighbors. \nThere’s plenty more to keep you entertained. Bass-expanding mini speakers that run on rechargeable batteries and play your digital music, wherever you go. Perfect for the dorm room or sitting by the pool. Headphones. Vintage turntables – get the look of yesterday’s classic phonographs with today’s high-quality manufacturing standards. Power amplifiers, horn speakers, and waterproof speakers for your garden. Tripods and speaker stands. \nPyle Pro: \nfeatures a huge range of musical instruments, DJ equipment, and accessories for your every need. All of our products have been designed with the professional in mind. You don't just see or hear the quality - you feel it. And whether you're a hard-working musician, studio engineer, or even a budding amateur, Pyle Pro has something to offer. \nAmong Pyle Pro’s most popular items are our PA Systems. Pyle is constantly modernizing these powerful devices to meet the demands of the modern user. Our flagship PAs include wireless microphones, rechargeable batteries, and iPod/iPhone docks. They’re great for use in large areas and events – at churches for weddings, at schools, gyms, birthday parties – anything indoor or outdoor where your voice needs to be heard loud and clear. And they’re easily transportable, thanks to caster wheels and telescoping handles. Use it for any audio – voice, guitar, CD, MP3 player – they handle everything. \nPyle’s emerging guitar line is also grabbing the attention of the music industry. Models are available in double-cutaway and Les Paul styles, with solid rosewood bodies in a variety of colors. Beginner kits including Pyle has also introduced a huge variety of effects pedals. Rounding out Pyle Pro’s line are our USB-to-analog converters, including a 2-channel mixer with USB input and output.",

  "description": "Get everything you need for a great sounding home theater speaker setup in a single box! You get four satellite speakers and a center channel speaker for the mid- and high-range audio signals, plus an 8-Inch powered subwoofer to handle the low frequencies. All the speakers come with an attractive black finish and convenient spring-loaded signal connectors. The center speakers use two 3-Inch shielded mid-range cones, while the satellites employ one 3-Inch cone and a 1/2-Inch dome tweeter. However, don't let the small size fool you! These 8 ohm speakers will handle up to 125 watts of power from your home theater receiver at frequencies from 150 Hz to 20 kHz. The subwoofer is powered by a 60 watt (RMS) amplifier, driving a downward firing 8-Inch cone. It can take either line or speaker-level inputs, so can be used with any amplifier, even older amps without dedicated subwoofer outputs. The subwoofer handles frequencies between 50 Hz to 250 Hz and includes adjustable crossover frequency and volume balance controls. Also included in the box are four C brackets for mounting the satellite speakers to the wall and the necessary hardware for mounting the speakers to the brackets. A pair of plastic feet to properly orient the face of the center speaker is also included. Note that you will need to provide your own hardware for mounting the C brackets to the wall or other vertical surface. Don't let the low price fool you! This speaker system sounds great and will fill your room with high-quality, full-spectrum sound! Note: The speaker wire connectors on each unit comfortably accept a maximum 16 gauge speaker wire. For best results use pin-type speaker plugs to make the speaker connections and banana or pin-type plugs to connect the wires to your amplifier.",

The resulting bass response is powerfully rich and impactful. \nNew Twisted Flare Port contributes to clear and tight bass \nAdvanced YST II (Yamaha Active Servo Technology II) \n10” Cone woofer \nStylish addition to any room \nClear and Tight Bass \nThe new Twisted Flare Port takes advantage of extensive subwoofer development experience. The gently twisting flared shape creates a smooth flow of air around the edge of the port versus the turbulent air flow around a conventional port. This reduces extraneous noise not present in the original input signal and provides clear, accurate low frequency reproduction. From special effect sounds in movies to the atmosphere of a live venue, you hear bass that is clear, tight and realistic. \nDeep Lows \nDeveloped by Yamaha, the Advanced YST II (Yamaha Active Servo Technology II) combines negative-impedance and constant-current principles to drive the speaker cone with even tighter control than the previous version. Using Advanced Negative Impedance Converter (ANIC) circuits, this system dynamically optimizes effective speaker impedance to maintain excellent linearity. This means more stable and accurate low range response, not to mention higher sound quality. \nMore than a Black Box \nThe gently rounded form with a slanted front surface is stylishly elegant. Designed to be unobtrusive, it’s sure to look beautiful in a living room or home theater room and will match a wide range of speaker systems. More than a black box, it’s the heartbeat of your home theater system. \nNS-SW050 NS-SW100 NS-SW200 NS-SW300 \nAdd to Cart \nAdd to Cart \nSee Details \nSee Details \nCustomer Reviews \n4.6 out of 5 stars \n1,729\n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n1,729\n\t\n— \n\t\n4.2 out of 5 stars \n106\n\t\nPrice $179.95$179.95 \t$179.95$179.95 \t— \t— \t\nDriver 8\" cone \t10\" cone \t8\" cone \t10\" cone \t\nOutput Power 50 W (100 Hz, 5 ohms, 10% THD) \t50 W (100 Hz, 5 ohms, 10% THD) \t130 W \t250 W \t\nHigh-Efficiency Power Amplifier - \t- \tYes \tYes \t\nFrequency Response 28–200 Hz \t25-180 Hz \t28–200 Hz \t20-160 Hz \t\nAdvanced YST Yes \tYes \tYes \tYes \t\nTwisted Flare port Yes \tYes \tYes \tYes \t\nFinish Textured black \tTextured black \tPiano black \tPiano black \t\nDimensions (W x H x D) 11-1/2” x 11-1/2” x 13-3/8” \t13-7/8” x 13-7/8” x 16-1/8\" \t11-3/8” x 12” x 13-7/8” \t13-3/4” x 14-3/8” x 16-1/2” \t\nWeight 18.7 lbs. \t26.5 lbs. \t24.7 lbs. \t39.7 lbs.",

And confirm that the surrounding current signals will not cause interference. Please make sure all the cable completely pushed into the device, incompletely connections will create distorted. \nCan bluetooth function and wired connection be used simultaneously? \nPlease note that the Bluetooth function and the wired function cannot be used at the same time, so when you want to use the amplifier via the Bluetooth function, do not connect any devices to the jacks (except the microphone jack). \nCan you connect two devices with bluetooth? \nNo, connecting two at the same time will cause the audio stream to be disrupted. It can only be disconnected and then connected to other devices. \nIf you find that the Bluetooth connection is unstable, you can try the following steps to solve it. \nMake sure there are no obstacles (especially metals) blocking the signal. Turn off the power amplifier, disconnect and clear the connection of the Bluetooth transmitting device, and try to reconnect. \nWhy only one channel work ? Is it defective? \nSince the amplifier is not used alone, it needs to be used together with other electronic equipment, so it needs to be ruled out one by one! Are the positive and negative wires connected to the speaker connected together?",

Designed for the way you live, LG televisions (the world's most intelligent TVs), audio and video technology can truly make life good. And whether you love movies, sports, the latest TV shows, documentaries, indie films, music, or podcasts, creating the home theater that delivers your favorite entertainment flawlessly has never been easier. From OLED and NanoCell TVs with amazing picture quality and super-smart LG ThinQ® AI, to sound bars that deliver the ultimate in surround audio, our home electronics collection gives you the power to create a cinematic experience in your living room, your den, or wherever you like to kick back and watch your favorite entertainment. Discover some of the ways that LG home theater technology will transform your space. LG TelevisionsWhether you choose an 8K or 4K OLED TV, or a 4K television featuring LG's NanoCell technology, you'll get rich color, deep blacks and stunning detail that will transform everything you watch. And with Dolby Vision™¹ and Dolby Atmos®¹, you'll get advanced image and sound technologies inspired by the cinema. By combing these two advancements into our OLED and NanoCell TVs, they work to not only optimize your picture, but your sound too—delivering ultra-vivid images and powerful, moving audio that seems to flow all around you. In addition, with the new Apple AirPlay 2, you can access one of the largest libraries of Dolby Vision content, and you can effortlessly cast anything from your Apple iPhone or laptop to your LG TV. And you can even sync music with other AirPlay 2-compatible speakers anywhere in your home. Plus, with WiSA2 compatibility, your LG OLED TV is designed to work seamlessly with WiSA-enabled speakers to deliver high-fidelity sound wirelessly to wherever your WiSA-enabled speakers are—which can dramatically elevate the cinematic sound of everything you watch. Along with that, our TVs come equipped with the latest HDMI3 ports, which means they support wider bandwidths for higher frame rates—so it's easy to enjoy fast-paced games, fast action scenes and high-speed sports with minimal input lag and enhanced responsiveness. Of course, all our premium televisions also include ThinQ AI (and they're the first with the Google Assistant4 and Alexa built in)—which means that they'll not only become the centerpiece of your home entertainment system, but they'll become the center for your smart home. And, in order to help you make the most of your smart TV, LG televisions include our simple, award-winning webOS5 platform and our intuitive Magic Remote5—giving you a convenient home dashboard that puts all your smart home devices front and center, and a fun, easy and intuitive way to find the best entertainment recommendations for the way you watch—and control your TV and compatible smart home devices. LG Sound BarsWhether you choose a single sound bar or an entire audio system, LG gives you access to the leading audio processing technology—with sound quality that surpasses CDs, and stunning 24-bit/192kHz audio resolution—which is as close to original sound as you can get. (Compatible high-resolution music files required, sold separately.) In addition, with Dolby Atmos, our audio devices will transport you into the story with moving audio that flows all around you with breathtaking realism. And because DTS:X places sound where it would occur naturally in space, you'll feel like you're in the middle of a car chase or hear a storm thundering above you—and get an even more lifelike experience. LG Video Of course, no LG home entertainment system would be complete without a video component (or two). With projectors and Blu-ray players that allow you to watch streaming content in larger-than-life size, as well as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, it's easy to play the content you own already—and new movies or shows that you've rented or b",

    "2-Way Home Speaker System: The Saiyin On-Wall speakers deliver stereo sound to any room in your home or office. A solution for a total surround-sound system when space is limited and performance is key. The compact proportions make installation a breeze to bring huge dimensionality with a speaker that makes itself heard but without cluttering floor space.",
    "Amplifier or Receiver Required: To use these passive speakers, you will need an amplifier or receiver to power them. Simply connect the speakers to your preferred amplifier or receiver, and you're good to go. The ON-WALL speaker features a unique down-firing bass port system, allowing for flexible room placement, even against a wall. ❗❗Please note that speaker wires are not included, so you'll need to acquire those separately.",
    "Silk Square Horn Tweeters and 3.5” Bass Drivers: The surround sound speakers utilize the 3.5 inch horn tweeters producing crystal clear high frequencies & taking response up to 20,000 Hz for life-like high frequencies. For bass, the speakers use 3.5-inch drivers delivering smooth and rich low-frequencies. Each speaker also has a dual-horn reflex port that enhances the performance of the woofer.",
    "Wall Mount Design: With the customized wall mounting kit, these speakers can be easily installed on any flat surface in your home or office. This design not only provides a clean and sleek look but also ensures wide-range sound performance without compromising on quality. The speaker bracket spacing is specifically designed to be only 3mm, allowing for a tight attachment to the wall using matching screws. This maximizes your limited space while delivering an unparalleled audio experience.",
    "All-Wood MDF Cabinet: The wall speakers feature all-wood MDF cabinets, which effectively reduce cabinet resonance. The classic design and elegant wood finish of these cabinets make them suitable for both contemporary and vintage-themed setups. They add a touch of elegance and style to your sound system, meeting your requirements for the great audio experience.",
    "Specification: Easy to drive 4-Ohm nominal impedance - Compatible with most home theater receivers, stereos or home theater processors. Frequency Response: 60Hz-20kHz; Impedance: 4 Ohms;Enclosure Type:Bottom Firing Ports; Rated Power:5-30 Watts (Each); Dimensions: 13\" (H) x 2.9\" (W) x 7.9\"(L) (Each)"

  "description": "NOTE: This listing is for one speaker, buy as many as needed! The Micca M-Series of in-wall and in-ceiling speakers have been designed for optimal performance in a wide variety of home entertainment applications, from providing relaxed background music to a high-impact 7-channel home theater system. Built with high-quality components and rigorously tested design, M-Series speakers deliver exceptional value and are well reviewed by owners and critics. Dynamic and Balanced The M-8S is a 2-way in-wall speaker with a high excursion 8\" poly woofer and a 1\" soft dome tweeter. This combination provides great flexibility in terms of application and suitability to different music tastes. In addition to smooth and natural vocals, the 8\" woofer is capable of robust bass output. This allows the M-8S to be used without the need for a subwoofer in many installations, or seamless integration if a subwoofer is used. Imaging and Clarity The 1\" soft dome tweeter provides abundant detail and clarity, generating solid and focused imaging for all sound sources in a spacious sound stage. Designed for a broadened listening sweet spot, the tweeter employs a diffuser to assist with the off-axis response as well as a pivoting mechanism to achieve proper aiming. Perfect integration between the tweeter and woofer is achieved through a 12dB crossover network. Once installed and set up, the M-8S projects a realistic sound stage with excellent resolution. Specifications - Woofer: 8\" Mica-Poly Cone, Rubber Surround - Tweeter: 1\" Silk Dome - Crossover: 12dB/Octave - Frequency Response: 40Hz-20kHz - Impedance: 8 Ohms - Sensitivity: 90dB 1W/1M - Power: 100 Watts (Each) - Outer Dimension: 10\" (W) x 14.1\" (H) - Cutout: 8.7\" (W) x 12.7\" (H) - Mounting Depth: 3.4\"",

Pivoting design means the tweeter can be aimed for a spacious sound stage. \n\t\nAdvanced Crossover Design \nPerfect integration between the tweeter and woofer is achieved through a 12dB crossover network that ensures coherent transition in the critical upper midrange region. \n\t\nEasy Installation \nUse the included template to mark and cut the mounting hole with a drywall knife.

Please do not rely on this size to determine if the speaker will fit a install location. \nTo select the right speaker size for your project, please refer to the product dimensions, wall cutout dimensions, and mounting depth listed in the table above. \nSelection considerations \nThe M-8S and M-6S shares common components and design with other Media Series in-wall/in-ceiling speakers, making for a perfect tonal match when mixed and matched. For a given installation location, it is always recommended to install the largest Media Series speaker model that will fit. Doing so provides the fullest sound and best performance at all playback levels. In locations where the larger M-8S will not fit, the smaller M-6S can be used instead.",

  "description": "The RockTower 68B passive tower speaker delivers audiophile grade sound quality at an unbeatable price!. . Design. The Rocktower series of speakers come in 3 beautiful finishes. This listing is for the Black grain. We also offer it in classic wood grain, and white grain. The bottom of the speaker has a concealed and sturdy stand to finish the look. We also designed these to look great with the grills or without grills so you can rock the style you desire.. . Power. The power handling is an incredible 125 watts RMS each speaker! Even if you over-power these a little it would be fine because we under-rate their RMS power. The peak burst rating is 500 watts.. . 3-Way smart configuration. This speaker is built with a very smart configuration. It is a 3-way speaker that separated the highs, mids, and bass to different drivers. We use (2) 6.5\" woofers to drive the bass, and (1) 6.5\" driver dedicated to the midrange frequencies, and a 1\" silk dome tweeter for crystal clear high frequencies.. . Enclosure. We enclose the speakers in a high quality MDF tower enclosure. (NO particle board Allowed!). We added a vent to the enclosure to give the low frequencies a boost. These sound great n their own and they sound even better with an added sub.. . Rear panel. Our rear panel features everything you want in a passive speaker. The gold plated 5-way binding post terminals give the flexibility to use banana plugs, spade terminals, or bare wire.. . Impedance options. This listing is for the 8 ohm version and it is perfect if you want to run 1 to each channel of your amplifier or if you want to run 2 in parallel to each channel of your amplifier.",

    "rawText": "From the manufacturer\nPair Rockville RockTower 68B Black Home Audio Tower Speakers Passive 8 Ohm \nThe RockTower 68B passive tower speaker delivers audiophile grade sound quality. \nDesign The Rocktower series of speakers come in 3 beautiful finishes. This listing is for the Black grain. We also offer it in classic wood grain, and white grain. The bottom of the speaker has a concealed and sturdy stand to finish the look. We also designed these to look great with the grills or without grills so you can rock the style you desire. \nPower The power handling is an incredible 125 watts RMS each speaker! Even if you over-power these a little it would be fine because we under-rate their RMS power. The peak burst rating is 500 watts. \n3-Way smart configuration This speaker is built with a very smart configuration. It is a 3-way speaker that separated the highs, mids, and bass to different drivers. We use (2) 6.5” woofers to drive the bass, and (1) 6.5” driver dedicated to the midrange frequencies, and a 1” silk dome tweeter for crystal clear high frequencies. \nEnclosure We enclose the speakers in a high quality MDF tower enclosure. (NO particle board Allowed!). We added a vent to the enclosure to give the low frequencies a boost. These sound great n their own and they sound even better with an added sub. \nRear panel Our rear panel features everything you want in a passive speaker. The gold plated 5-way binding post terminals give the flexibility to use banana plugs, spade terminals, or bare wire. \nImpedance options This listing is for the 8 ohm version and it is perfect if you want to run 1 to each channel of your amplifier or if you want to run 2 in parallel to each channel of your amplifier. \nFeatures: \nRockville RockTower 68B Black Grain Home Audio tower Speaker\nRMS Power: 125 Watts\nPeak Power: 500 Watts\nWoofer: 6.5” x 2\nMidrange: 6.5” x 1\nTweeter: 1” Silk dome tweeter\nEach Woofer has a 15 oz magnet and 1.25” voice coil\nMidrange has 8 oz magnet and 1” voice coil\nCabinet material: Top quality MDF with beautiful vinyl wood grain finish\nSilk dome tweeter gives crisp and realistic sounding highs (silk dome are generally more musical)\nDetachable grill (speaker looks amazing with and without the grill)\nVented enclosure gives a boost of punchy bass at low frequencies\nGold-plated 5-way binding post terminals can accept banana, bare wire, spade terminals, and more\nImpedance: 8 ohm\nColor: Black Grain (also available in white grain and classic wood grain)\nUltra-stiff Polypropylene dust cap on woofer\nBuilt-in 3-way crossover separates frequencies so each driver can work together\nRubber surrounds on woofer\nFrequency Response: 30Hz-20KHz\nSensitivity:87 dB 1W/1m\nHigh Quality Golden Terminals\nDimensions of each speaker (inches): 10.43” x 7.87” x 41.73”\nOne pc speakers Shipping carton dimensions (inches): 14.2*11.4*46.5inch\nWeight per speaker: 26.2 lb",

  "description": "An intelligent fan system designed for cooling audio video, DJ, server, network, and IT equipment racks. Protects rack-mount equipment from overheating, performance issues, and shortened lifespans. Programmable thermostat controller with automated speed control, alarm warnings, and backup memory. Premium anodized aluminum construction with CNC-machined detailing for a professional appearance. Size: 2U Rack Space | Design: Intake | Airflow: 50 to 220 CFM | Noise: 10 to 36 dBA | Bearings: Dual Ball Product Details An intelligent cooling fan system designed to be mounted onto a wide range of 19-inch racks requiring quiet or high airflow cooling. Maintaining an optimal temperature for rack-mount equipment prevents overheating, ensures constant performance, and extends their lifespan. The LCD digital controller features a programmable thermostat with automated speed control, alarm warnings, status alerts, and backup memory. The system is housed in a solid aluminum construction that takes up two rack units of space (2U). Each aluminum frame is anodized with a light-brush finish, then the corners CNC-machined and edges symmetrically cut for a high-end professional appearance. This model holds four custom-engineered dual-ball bearing fans rated at 67,000 hours, and certified by CE and RoHS. The fans are set to intake cooler air and should be positioned near the bottom of the rack; an exhaust version of this model is available, sold separately. This complete kit includes the 2U fan unit, corded 6-ft thermal probe, user’s manual, rack mount screws, cage nuts, and corded 6-ft power supply. Intelligent Cooling Programming includes an easy-to-use thermostat and a SMART mode that automatically adjusts the fan’s speed to react to varying temperatures. Additional features include alarm alerts, fan failure triggers, power savings setting, display lock, and backup memory. Six fan speeds are available with three screen brightness settings. Behind the unit is an expansion port that can control another CLOUDPLATE unit or an AC Infinity rack roof dual-fan kit. Performance and Applications This 2U rack cooling system features programmable fan speed control, enabling it to work for a wide range of rack mount applications. With a noise level that can reach 10 dBA, the fan system can be used for environments where low or minimal noise is required such as home theater, studio, DJ, and audio video racks. A max airflow rating of 220 CFM will provide sufficient cooling to server, network, IT and equipment racks requiring high airflow. This fan system contains premium dual-ball bearings, allowing it to be mounted horizontally or vertically. Product Identification Manufacturer AC Infinity Inc.

  "description": "An intelligent fan system designed for cooling audio video, DJ, server, network, and IT equipment racks. Protects rack-mount equipment from overheating, performance issues, and shortened lifespans. Programmable thermostat controller with automated speed control, alarm warnings, and backup memory. Premium anodized aluminum construction with CNC-machined detailing for a professional appearance. Size: 3U Rack Space | Design: Intake | Airflow: 60 to 300 CFM | Noise: 12 to 38 dBA | Bearings: Dual Ball Product Details An intelligent cooling fan system designed to be mounted onto a wide range of 19-inch racks requiring quiet or high airflow cooling. Maintaining an optimal temperature for rack-mount equipment prevents overheating, ensures constant performance, and extends their lifespan. The LCD digital controller features a programmable thermostat with automated speed control, alarm warnings, status alerts, and backup memory. The system is housed in a solid aluminum construction that takes up three rack units of space (3U). Each aluminum frame is anodized with a light-brush finish, then the corners CNC-machined and edges chamfered for a high-end professional appearance. This model holds three custom-engineered dual-ball bearing fans rated at 67,000 hours, and certified by CE and RoHS. The fans are set to intake cooler air and should be positioned near the bottom of the rack; an exhaust version of this model is available, sold separately. This complete kit includes the 3U fan unit, corded 6-ft thermal probe, user’s manual, rack mount screws, cage nuts, and corded 6-ft power supply. Intelligent Cooling Programming includes an easy-to-use thermostat and a SMART mode that automatically adjusts the fan’s speed to react to varying temperatures. Additional features include alarm alerts, fan failure triggers, power savings setting, display lock, and backup memory. Six fan speeds are available with three screen brightness settings. Behind the unit is an expansion port that can control another CLOUDPLATE unit or an AC Infinity rack roof dual-fan kit. Performance and Applications This 3U rack cooling system features programmable fan speed control, enabling it to work for a wide range of rack mount applications. With a noise level that can reach 12 dBA, the fan system can be used for environments where low or minimal noise is required such as home theater, studio, DJ, and audio video racks. A max airflow rating of 300 CFM will provide sufficient cooling to server, network, IT and equipment racks requiring high airflow. This fan system contains premium dual-ball bearings, allowing it to be mounted horizontally or vertically. Product Identification Manufacturer AC Infinity Inc.

As you sit in your car, you are isolated from outside noise and surrounded by speakers. You become enveloped in sound.

This product uses high grade components from the ground up and delivers clean sound with tight and thumpy bass you can really feel. The enclosure is made of high quality MDF which delivers superb sound. We use a highly efficient class “D” amplifier that is engineered to be perfectly matched with the woofer and enclosure. We tested the rear firing port and determined it delivers the best bass response where you get optimal reflection that will disburse the sound throughout the room. The woofer is top quality with foam surrounds and features a Y30 grade magnet, and a 4-layer voice coil. Our subwoofer has RCA inputs and outputs as well as high level speaker inputs and outputs to support any setup.",

It provides a simple way to connect speakers across the room. Conceal speaker wire in the wall instead of fastening it to the baseboard for a secure and professional-looking installation. Connect the binding posts with 12 to 18 AWG bare speaker wire, banana plugs, or spade connectors. The subwoofer coupler port connects a subwoofer cable. \nSturdy Construction \nThis sturdy wall plate is built to last. Painted screws are included with this three-piece wall plate for a professional-looking installation. \nImportant Notes \nCompatible with a standard double gang low-voltage wall bracket\nSome models of banana plug connectors may not fit when used on both sides due to the length of the terminals\nThis wall plate is not interchangeable with a Decora wall plate",

  "description": "Product DescriptionRemarkably sophisticated with the sound quality of much bigger speakers, the ProMonitor 1000 incorporates top-of-the-line Definitive Technology features for amazing home theater experiences. The speaker features BDSS driver coupled with a pressure-driven low-frequency radiator, a pure aluminum dome tweeter and a non-resonant PolyStone speaker cabinet that together produce rich, warm lifelike audio with smooth high-frequency reproduction. Small enough to hide yet attractive enough to show off, the speakers can be placed on a shelf, on a stand or mounted on a wall. The best satellite speaker in the acclaimed Pro Series, ProMonitor 1000 speakers pair with a ProCenter 2000 and matching ProSub for a complete ProCinema sound system.From the ManufacturerThe ProMonitor 1000 is Definitive's largest and best satellite speaker in the acclaimed Pro Series. Four ProMonitor 1000s along with a ProCenter 2000 and ProSub 1000 makes a complete ProCinema 1000 system. All the components of the system are packed and sold separately allowing you to mix and match Pro Series components to build the system that best suits your needs. Small size speaker has remarkable sophistication and huge sound Easy to place with the built-in keyhole mount. View larger Bass radiators enhance low frequency performance for more true-to-life sound Rubber-tipped tripod stand ensures slip and mark-free shelf mounting Don't let the ProMonitor 1000's small size and affordable price fool you -- it is a remarkably sophisticated product with huge sound. The 1000 incorporates many of the same technologies as Definitive's top-of-the-line models including BDSS drivers, pure aluminum dome tweeters, and planar pressure coupled mid/bass radiators for home theater sound quality that will shock your friends and family when they hear your system for the first time.The Secret to Their Big SoundCompeting satellite speakers of this size usually have weak lower-midrange response; that part of the audio range that contains the \"warmth\" and \"body\" of voices and musical instruments. Listen to a male vocal on typical small satellite speakers and you will instantly hear the weakness in the lower midrange. The ProMonitor satellites avoid this critical problem by pressure-coupling exclusive BDSS technology driver to an equal-sized mid/bass radiator cleverly placed on the top of the satellite. This technique doubles the lower-midrange radiating area of the speaker without increasing the size of the enclosure. You’ll enjoy the kind of rich, warm and life-like sound quality that you thought was only possible with big, hard to place speakers.Easy to Place, Easy to UseSmall enough to disappear in a room but beautiful when in plain view, the 1000 satellites can be shelf-mounted with their unique tri-lobed base, wall-mounted using the built-in keyhole mount, or mounted using optional ProMount 90 articulating pivot wall mounts (sold separately).The SoundSonically, the ProMonitor 1000 satellite is a revelation in terms of achieving incredible sound at an affordable price. Their imaging is absolutely boxless, spacious and three dimensional while delivering pinpoint specificity and localization when called for. They are velvety smooth with you-are-there presence which is hard to find at any price and unheard of in this price range. The 1000 is dynamic but capable of great subtlety so it excels equally with music or movies.Technical SpecificationsDimensions: 6.25 by 10.88 by 6.5 inches (W x H x D)Dimensions: 6.25 by 10.88 by 6.5 inches (W x H x D)Frequency response: 47 Hz to 30 kHzFrequency response: 47 Hz to 30 kHzRecommended amplification: 10 to 200 wattsRecommended amplification: 10 to 200 wattsEfficiency: 90 dBEfficiency: 90 dBDriver complement: 1 x 5.25\" bass/midrange driver; 1 x 5.25\" planar low-frequency radiator; 1 x 1\" aluminum dome tweeterDriver complement: 1 x 5.25\" bass/midrange driver; 1 x 5.25\" planar low-frequency radiator; 1 x 1\" aluminum dome tweeterMagnetic shielding: YesMagnetic shielding: YesFinish: Gloss blackFinish: Gloss black",

  "description": "The Silver Ticket Products STR-169135-WAB Fixed Frame projection screen offers powerful performance for the price. This screen features real projection screen material, not a sheet. The material is a white, woven 1.1 gain material that is designed for speakers to be placed behind it with no noticeable sound reduction or distortion. This screen truly assembles much faster than any other brand available! Forget about tucking the screen material into the frame - the Silver Ticket Tension Rod System saves you time and frustration. How does the material connect to the frame? Each side of the material has a pocket. A rod slides through the pocket to attach to the frame. This saves you time during assembly, but also removes any puckers or wrinkles in the viewing surface. The rod holds the material perfectly square all around the whole frame. This pocket and rod system remains hidden behind the frame so you only see the movie. Forget about tricky installations - this fixed frame screen mounts on the wall much like a large picture frame. The sturdy aluminum frame is WRAPPED, not flocked, with a light absorbing black velvet fabric to absorb over-projected light so you don't have to be a professional when aligning your projector. While other brands use square tubing in their frames, this screen is built with durable extruded aluminum that contours down to the projected image so you won't have any ugly shadow on the image area. Join the thousands of satisfied customers -- buy Silver Ticket today!",

  "description": "This carbon fiber in-ceiling speaker is the perfect combination of performance and style. The use of carbon fiber for the woofer means that the speaker can hit harder, go lower, and handle more power with significantly less distortion than conventional drivers. The silk dome tweeter produces clean, crisp, and clear highs and mids. You can fine tune the blend of sound using the built-in high frequency attenuator in case the sound is too bright. The metal grille can be painted to match your ceiling and attaches easily using magnets.  All Alpha series in-wall and ceiling speakers are sonically matched to provide a uniform sound stage across you entire listening area. Simple two channel listening rooms to full screening rooms with 7.2.4 Atmos and DTS-X immersive cinema systems will benefit from the matched components of the Alpha series carbon fiber installation speakers.",
  "features": [
    "Carbon Fiber drivers hit harder with deeper bass and handle more power significantly less distortion than conventional drivers.",

We have a wide range of speakers, amplifiers, and head units that will enrich your car audio experience. You’d be surprised at how much better your music can sound with an upgrade from the factory speakers and amplifier. \nPyle Car: \nWe have a wide range of speakers, amplifiers, and head units that will enrich your car audio experience.
